"Letter to A. V. Zatayevich, 1897","Congratulations to you, my dear friend Alexander Viktorovich, on the New Year, in which I wish you, firstly, happiness - and secondly, to compose and compose more.
  
  I am very surprised that I have not received letters from you yet. I sent my last letter to you on December 13th. It was sent by registered mail, and therefore could not have disappeared. I informed you in it that Jurgenson had agreed to print three of your works and that you should therefore send them to me as soon as possible. I gave some information about myself for the magazine. Could it be that my servant did not send this letter? To tell the truth, I did not ask for a receipt... I am sending you my portrait for the magazine. I will send it to you personally in about ten days.
  
  Yours sincerely, S. Rachmaninov",Letter
"Letter to A. K. Glazunov, 1897","Dear Alexander Konstantinovich!
  
  Please forgive me for disturbing you, but I really want to know when my Symphony is scheduled for performance. I was confused by one acquaintance who just arrived from St. Petersburg, who told me that it was supposedly scheduled for January 18th. Although I hardly believe this, I would still like to hear confirmation from you.
  
  If it is not too much trouble, please also let me know who will conduct and whether you are rewriting it into parts, or if it is better for me to do it here.
  
  Then I would like to thank you very much for scheduling my Symphony in your program.
  
  I await your reply.
  
  Yours sincerely, S. Rachmaninov

"Letter to A. V. Zatayevich, 1897","Dear friend Alexander Viktorovich!
  
  I have been unwell all of late. The reason for my ill health was my ""distracted"" way of life, in general a life that is now absolutely forbidden to me and which I myself no longer hope to live.
  
  In the last month or so I have completely fallen apart and only now am I thinking that it is time to start studying and also to answer those letters that have been demanding it for a long time.
  
  Yesterday I received your letter and your things. I sent you one of them back, together with my piano things. It is no good, because it is not a piano at all. Besides, its name is ""choir"". Anyone can quite reasonably ask: why hasn't this been done for a choir? After all, a piano cannot replace it. I find the same thing, adding to this that this thing will sound much better in a choir and this music will be more appropriate (more characteristic) with the words. It just seems to me (and I could be wrong, of course) that the words you chose are not suitable for the music, and here's why. They make you pause every line, and you emphasize it yourself, i.e., you make the accompaniment sit in one place, when it could move beautifully on sustained notes in the voices. Throughout the first page, I liked the constant pauses, but when they began to repeat on the next page, it seemed unnatural to me. Still, this thing is original, and that's what I like most about your things. I'm keeping the second thing. To tell the truth, I like it less than the choir. But what I don't like at all is that you write little. These two things, as you say, you pulled out of the old trash. What new things are you writing? If nothing, then it makes me very sad. If this is not something for the piano, then why don't you send it to me, but feed me only with promises? You can't study like that, my dear friend. You need to work as much as you have free time. You have talent, but you don't seem to want to know about it.
  
  Send me two more piano pieces by all means. I can perhaps arrange for Jurgenson to print all four. Of course, you need this - there's no need to talk about that - but you're still being frugal with sending them. Send them quickly, otherwise when will all this come out?
  
  Forgive me for the lecture.
  
  Yours sincerely, S. Rachmaninov

"Letter to N. D. Skalon, 1897","I arrived here yesterday morning, dear Tatusha, and I am leaving here this evening. I was not expected in the morning, and therefore I was not met. I arrived at my grandmother's at seven o'clock in the morning, she was the only one who had already gotten up. (Volodya and his wife were not up yet.) On the way I had to sleep only three hours - no more, since yesterday I dozed almost all day, but did not go to bed in order to sit with my people. My grandmother is not getting old at all, in my opinion. She is still the same.
  
  I like Volodya very much. From everything I have seen and heard, he is a very good man. I have to talk about him as if I were seeing him for the first time in my life. His wife is very sweet, very nice and not at all stupid. Apparently, they love each other terribly. She only looks at him and becomes cheerful only when he begins to tell something. Then she supports only the conversation that he begins. It is fun for me to look at them. I am very pleased to see this, and I am ready to ask God, that this wonderful relationship would not disappear with time. They have been married for so little time! Everyone is asking me to stay another day - but I will not agree...
  
  Now I want to thank you and your sisters for the money you gave me for the trip. When I went from you to Glazunov and imagined that I would suddenly have to ask him for a loan, I was horrified by this thought alone. However, I still would not have asked him for it in the end, even if I did not have your money in my pocket. My tongue would not have turned...
  
  From there I stopped by Varlikh. He told me that he would probably include Gypsy Capriccio in the program of their concert on St. Thomas's Week. I promised him to come. If he performs it, then I will probably come.
  
  Goodbye. I thank you and your sisters once again for your wonderful attitude, touching attention to me, which I have seen from you. I kiss your six little hands. I bow to everyone.
  
  Yours S. Rachmaninov
  
  P.S. A small detail. I am writing here now, and my grandmother does not allow anyone in the neighboring rooms to talk on this occasion.

"Letter to A. V. Zatayevich, 1897","""I haven't written letters for a long time, my dear friend Alexander Viktorovich. Neither to you nor to anyone else. The main reason for this is my weakness, which makes me lie down all the time. This is my annual spring state. I lie down and occasionally read. I can't compose either. All this lasts until my arrival in the village, where I quickly come to my senses and begin to work, so that now I only dream of leaving... I haven't thanked you yet for the congratulatory telegram on my birthday, which touched me very much with your memory. I also haven't told you about my impressions after the performance of my first Symphony. I will do this now, although it is difficult for me, since I still cannot sort them out myself. The only thing that is true is that I am not at all touched by failure, that I am not at all discouraged by the abuse of the newspapers - but what deeply upsets me and has a hard effect on me is that my Symphony, despite the fact that I loved it very much before, I love it now, after the very first rehearsal, is not at all I liked it... So, bad instrumentation, you will say. But I am sure, I will answer, that good music will ""shine through"" even bad instrumentation, and I do not think that the instrumentation was completely unsuccessful. So, there remain two assumptions. Either I, like some authors, am unfairly partial to this composition, or this composition was poorly performed. And this was indeed the case. I am surprised that such a highly talented person as Glazunov can conduct so badly? I am not even talking about conducting technique (there is nothing to ask him about it), I am talking about his musicality. He feels nothing when he conducts. It is as if he does not understand anything! When Anton Rubinstein was once asked at dinner how he liked the singer N, who sang the part of the Demon, Rubinstein, instead of answering, took a knife and put it perpendicularly in front of the questioner. I can say the same. So, I admit that the performance could have been the reason for the failure. (I am not asserting, but I am admitting.) If this Symphony were familiar to the public, it would blame the conductor (I continue to ‚Äúadmit‚Äù), but if the piece is unfamiliar and poorly performed, the public is inclined to blame the composer. This seems to be a probable point of view. Moreover, this Symphony, if not decadent, as they write and understand this word, is indeed a little ‚Äúnew‚Äù. This means that it must be played according to the most precise instructions of the author, who, perhaps, would at least reconcile himself with the public a little by this, and the public with the work (i.e., the work would be more understandable for the public in this case). Isn‚Äôt that why my friends who went to Petersburg didn‚Äôt like it (not the public, but the Symphony), although when I played it for them myself, they said something different. At the moment, as you see, I am inclined to think that the performance is to blame. Tomorrow, I will probably change this opinion too. I will not give up the Symphony after all. In six months, when it is covered, I will look at it, maybe correct it and maybe print it - and maybe the passion will pass then. Then I will tear it up...
  
  Now about you. Are you writing anything? Since I am leaving, the printing of your things will have to be postponed until autumn. In the summer you will prepare more of them. Maybe we will print everything.
  
  I shake your hand firmly.
  
  S. Rachmaninov
  
  P.S. Do not write to me any more to Moscow. Wait for the summer address, which I will inform you in a few days.

  [Note fragment]
  Each number under the bass means some interval. Since you have written:
  6‚Äì
  6‚Äì5
  , this means that you need to take a sixth chord with a doubled sixth and lead one sixth into a fifth, according to the indication of the numbers (6‚Äì5). Thus, you already get a quintessex chord of a dominant chord. Its resolution should be known to you. The same thing is required to take from h to
  4‚Äì
  6‚Äì
  4‚Äì3
  , i.e. a quart-sixth chord with a doubled fourth, one of which is taken to the third (4‚Äì3). The result is a third-fourth chord. Resolution according to the rule.
  
  There is an error in the second task. Where there is a misunderstanding for you, one digit is missing. On b you need to take
  4‚Äì
  6‚Äì
  4‚Äì3
  , i.e. again a quart-sixth chord with a doubled fourth. One fourth goes to the third (4‚Äì3), while the other two voices (or intervals) ‚Äî the fourth and the sixth ‚Äî remain in place. The result is the third-fourth chord already known to you. Resolution according to the rule.

The reason is still the same, i.e. unforgivable laziness and indulgences that I allow myself to make lately. And my kidney disease, and therefore - at the beginning of the summer I could neither walk nor sit for long. I only lay down and intensively treated myself. Now I have recovered. The pain has almost left me. Thanks to this illness, no work came to mind and I wrote nothing at all. But I do not regret it, if only I could recover completely.

"Letter to N. D. Skalon, 1897","""Tursik! Your threat to write me long letters often is not a fact, apparently, but only words. And I believed your threat, and, of course, I was glad. Where are these letters, Tatura? If you call, say, two letters a month frequent writing, then I feel sorry for myself. In my naivety, I apparently misunderstood the word ""often"". And there is nothing to threaten with such writing! Let's say the word ""often"" is so elastic! I dare to assure you, I feel so sorry for myself, Tur-tur! I feel so sorry that if you could measure the extent of my pity, then, firstly, you yourself would feel sorry for me, and secondly, either you would not have made this threat, or, having made it once, you would have carried it out in practice. After this, you come out a traitor to your own words, Turka! I did not expect this from you.
  
  You have disturbed my peace with your promise; by not fulfilling it, you will make me ill, because that the doctor has strictly forbidden me to worry and excite my nervous system; thanks to your promise, I run ten times a day to the front door in the hope of finding a letter from you in the box and each time I return upstairs with nez besqu√© (I am not responsible for the spelling) on ‚Äã‚Äãthe fifth. (The French words ""nez besqu√©"", note this! means not raised upward, as you think, but crooked, lowered nose.) Don't you really feel sorry for me? After all, I love you so much, Tusik! Insidious Turturchki! Oh, life! However, I must now begin to answer your questions, otherwise you will probably get angry and thereby give my nervous system a reason to suffer even more, my heartlessly cold Turs.
  
  I will jump to the most pitiful prose. I will talk about money. Money and business first of all. (God has made me talk about money even with the Skalons!) I did not send you my debt with my uncle not because I had no money, but because I would have been terribly unpleasant and ashamed to talk to him about it. I left it to the last minute again. Forgive me, for God's sake, for this and advise me how I can send them to you. This worries and excites me very much (remember my nervous system).
  
  Our patients, Sonya and Feosha, are in the following situation. Sonya was at Snegiryov's, who said that she needs an operation, which is not dangerous and thanks to which, according to him, in ten days she will be completely healthy. The operation will be performed, upon the arrival of her uncle, by some doctors recommended by Grauerman. There is nothing to fear for this, since the operation, I repeat, is not dangerous.
  
  Feosha is in a worse situation. Rudnev finds that she has angina pectoris, with which, according to him, one can live for quite a long time under good conditions; otherwise, this thing is very dangerous. About her he told her this: ""If you continue to eat it, then in a year you will not be alive!"", because he finds it a great weakness. Feosha promised me not to do this. I monitor my medication intake...
  
  Now about the misunderstanding with my doctor. I was, in Ostroumov's absence, with his assistant, who examined me in the spring before him. All his words, which I quoted, were said as I wrote to you. The phrase where he advises me to come to him again in a month needs to be corrected a little. He does not advise him, but Ostroumov's doctor. However, in order to calm me down more and with Ostroumov's authoritative name, I was then told about the improvement. Still, I expected and assumed that Iv. Al. could catch me in this. When I finish the drops, then, probably, I will go to Ostroumov, because of Verochka, to whom I promised.
  
  Now the last message. They say, as if there will be a private opera after all, but it will start earlier in another theater, while the old one is undergoing some changes. However, no one comes to me from there. I myself will not come there without an invitation. Amen.
  
  My dearly beloved Turturinochek! I am ready to give a year of my life to kiss your hand now with its crooked, upward-raised fingers, which constitutes (my love is not blind) your physical defect.
  
  Yours, S. Rachmaninov

"Letter to N. D. Skalon, 1897","""A week ago I sent a letter to Verochka, dear Tatusha. No matter how much I waited, I haven't received a single one from you two. Although this is a short period, I'm starting to think that something might have happened to you. I received your last letter to me 9 days ago. This last letter of yours to me (by the way, very sweet) I thought was the fourth. I'm telling you this because you write that you've lost count of your letters to me, and by the way, this loud phrase has no place here, since the number of your letters is limited by the proverb: one, two, three and... that's it.
 
 However, I'm not angry! After all, in general, taking into account the proverb about [inaudible], you are a good young lady, so I don't want to quarrel with you, at least I'm restraining myself. Just write to me anyway. I'm now a very busy man, old, a little sick, very tired from a lot of work, and, finally, missing you. I miss your letters I fully deserve it. Isn't that so? Especially since you write so easily, so quickly; especially since you are so free! Have you really started to ""grow ugly""? This is terrible! Maybe there is some ulterior motive again? Then this is the play: ""Cunning and Love"", and one must be very naive not to understand which of us is the personification of the first. ""Zemfira! Remember, my dear friend! I blindly gave everything for a wish"", etc... Ah! Tata, Tata! However, I will remain silent!
 
 Now one more story about myself and that's enough. On Wednesday I conducted ""Samson and Delilah"" for the second time. It went as mediocrely as the first time. My next opera is ""Rogneda"". The newspapers all praise me. I have little faith! I get along with everyone at the theater. I still swear quite a lot. I am as good with Mamontov as he is with me.
 
 I repeat once again that I am very tired from work, and I also miss the Skalons very much - that means, if they are only compassionate, they will write to me more often. I kiss your hands. Greetings to all of yours.
 
 Yours, S. Rachmaninov

"Letter to A. V. Zatayevich, 1897","I haven't written to you for a very long time, my dear friend Alexander Viktorovich, but, by God, it won't be an exaggeration if I say that on account of my new position, in which I am a newcomer and which I still haven't gotten used to, I am busy 12 hours a day. I was and am so tired that, believe me, I couldn't think of anything else. But I have some business for you. I'll get to it quickly. I am sending you all your compositions that I have received. Of these, two mazurkas and the G major Feuille d'album have been marked by me for publication. Somehow, about a week and a half ago, I snatched an hour of time to correct a few little things, which I managed to do, and also to rework the ends of your mazurkas, which I only managed in one of them and that's not very important. I am talking now about the A minor one. In it, first of all, I left out four bars. Either agree with this or repeat this second theme. in some other, more interesting arrangement. Before the coda, a conclusion in the main key is necessary, which is what I did. If this does not satisfy you (I confess, I was in a hurry), then write something yourself, but be sure to follow the rules given above. As for the conclusion I have attached, I am quite reconciled with it, and if again it does not satisfy you, then again come up with something yourself. Just remember that your previous ending is absolutely no good. It spoils all the previous music. It gives the impression that you wanted to finish quickly, no matter how it turns out. You did not take the trouble to come up with something more interesting. Not even interesting, but simply something more suitable. In the G major Andante, the amendments are insignificant. I will not go into detail! But the whole problem is in the F major mazurka. Everything is good there, except for the conclusion. Yours is no good. Mine, although motivated by the previous one, is also no good. I spent quite a long time on it. sat, but came up with nothing. In the end, I decided that the author of such an original mazurka should also come up with a finale for it himself. It‚Äôs easier for him. And maybe mine, which follows from the previous finale, will push you to something more possible. But again, it can‚Äôt be left like this. Don‚Äôt be angry with me for this and, most importantly, don‚Äôt be lazy and sit over it a little longer. Remember that this is actually the first printing of your works, and that your further success with the publisher depends on it. Please, be strict with yourself in this case. Force yourself to redo all of this. After all, you, of course, can and have the strength to redo it. I don‚Äôt want critics to scold you for such thoughtless, tacked-on endings. After all, no one will agree to play these things like that, and the things are good.
 
 Now I also want to tell you that the F-major mazurka, as more bravura, is better placed as the last number. So fix all of this quickly and send it back to me quickly. I won't keep you with the seal.
 
 I shake your hand firmly. Devoted to you and wishing you success

 In order for the person you sent to be accepted as a cloakroom attendant, he needs to go to the theater with my card today to see Mr. Smelov, whom I have already warned about this.

"Letter to L. D. Skalon, 1897","Are you angry with me or not, dear Lelesha, for not answering your letter for so long? I still think not, because if I have a few free minutes, then, by God, I find it possible to devote them only to rest, to sitting quietly after the periodic running to the theater, after the theater classes and riots that get on my nerves.
 
 In our theater, there really is real chaos. No one knows what will happen not only the day after tomorrow, but what will happen tomorrow, even today. There is no one to sing, not because there are no singers, but because out of our large troupe of 30 people, about 25 people need to be fired for unsuitability. There is also nothing to give. That is, again, the repertoire is huge, but everything is going so badly, so dirty (with the exception of one ""Khovanshchina"") that 95% of the repertoire needs to be either thrown out completely, or really retrained.
 
 The theatre does not achieve either artistic or commercial goodness. For example, in the near future it has been decided to renew Verstovsky's ""Askold's Grave"" and ""Stormbreaker"". Well, please tell me, will there be any artistic or commercial benefit from these lousy operas? When I suggested instead staging Schumann's entire ""Manfred"" with Chaliapin in the title role, I was told that instead of a private opera there would be a literary and artistic circle. As if the above-mentioned operas do not have simple conversation instead of recitatives?
 
 Our trouble is that our main bosses are either not particularly smart people in the music business, or not particularly honest. Another bad thing is that we are managed not by one owner, but by ten owners, and each one says something of his own, which does not agree with the opinion of the others. But the worst thing is that S. Mamontov himself is indecisive and succumbs to any opinion. For example, I got him so carried away by the production of Manfred that he immediately ordered it to be staged. Not even five minutes had passed when his friend the artist Korovin, who doesn‚Äôt understand anything about music (but, by the way, a very nice and good person, like S. Mamontov), ‚Äã‚Äãtalked him out of it. Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôll try to persuade him to do it again.
 
 If only Chaliapin would agree to speak instead of sing. And Chaliapin should be absolutely magnificent in Manfred. As for the operas Rogneda and Snegurochka that were given to me, I myself am trying to persuade them not to stage them because they are going great at the Bolshoi Theatre, and we have neither the time nor the strength to stage them even tolerably. Their production is a sure failure! The production of Judith has been postponed. It will be staged after Sadko, which means around the tenth of January. And the performer of Judith has not yet been found. On November 28th, Carmen will probably be performed with me for the first time. On November 26th, Lyubatovich will debut with me for the first time as a soprano (Natasha) in Rusalka. In general, everything is going so badly that I am afraid of falling ill with a fit of black melancholy. By God!
 
 After all, I am still serving in the theater and I hope to endure this service until the end of the season, although, excluding the financial side, this time will not bring me any benefit, because I have crossed the conducting Rubicon, and now I only need the unconditional attention and subordination of the orchestra, which I will never get from them as a second conductor. By the way, one of these gentlemen recently slapped Esposito in front of the entire audience and the orchestra for, supposedly, some terrible curse words uttered by the latter. A report has been drawn up. This musician, they say, hit him so deftly that Esposito was knocked down and his pince-nez broke. My God! The matter will be heard by a justice of the peace. I am beginning to have a fit of melancholy. What is happening to me? God forbid!.. Esposito continues conducting!
 
 My greetings to Verochka, Tatusha and all of yours. I kiss your hands.
 
 Yours S. R.

"Letter to N. D. Skalon, 1897","""Where are you, dear Tatusha! Is it also possible to find out where your sisters are? What are they? What is wrong with you personally? About a week and a half ago I sent a letter to Lelya, to which I received no answer. I expected to receive at least one for my four pages, but I was mistaken. However, God be with you! Has Yakovlev started visiting you again?
 
 My affairs are still as bad. I seem to be beginning to suffer from black melancholy. It is a fact! I indulge in this melancholy for at least an hour a day. Today it has swallowed up the whole day, and even today I cried like a fool. Still, I am holding on. It is very dear to me. In the evening I decide to leave the theater; in the morning I decide to at least stay for this day. I have not yet started drinking vodka or wine at all, although almost every day I am among those invited by S. Mamontov to the tavern, where I sit and say nothing, but I am ready to give almost my word of honor that if things do not change, then I I'll start drinking. I'm very drawn to it.
 
 Tatusha, I'll die by the end of the season from black melancholy. Look, cry more! Come to my grave, even on those days when you're sure in advance that you won't have Ershov, Glazunov, or Yakovlev. I'll have a stone slab on my grave (I really want this), which you'll probably put up in memory of your former love for me - there's no one else who can pay for it. So sit down on this slab. Let your hair down! I swear by my pride, my self-love, my unblemished honor (all the bad qualities that are not appropriate in our time) that you'll be like Ophelia. There should be tears on your face, on your lips the words of my romance ""Dream"", dedicated to you, in which, by the way, I dreamed of good people. After sitting to your heart's content, go to a private opera to some performance where I was the conductor without the conductor's seat. And sit here. Only change your appearance here. Here your eyes should throw lightning; your lips should utter curses addressed to those who destroyed me. Your hair will also have to be put in order, otherwise it will be a lyrical look, which is out of place here. Of course, you will not get pleasure, but this is not surprising. And people in your position do not leave us satisfied.
 
 Having done this procedure several times, you can go to your Petersburg, to your ""Wednesdays"", for example. I let you go in peace. Your sadness (I allow it in the name of former love) will soon subside, you will soon begin to ""become prettier"" again and even, perhaps, will not regret that they wrote to me so rarely when I was still alive.

"Letter to M. I. Tchaikovsky, 1898","Dear Modest Ilyich!
 
 I have decided to address you with the following question. Would you consider it possible for yourself to write me a libretto for the Shakespeare plot that you offered me in the spring? Of course, I must sincerely add that I would be very happy if you agreed. If my affairs are arranged, I think I will begin writing for this plot in two or three months. I would like to know whether you can write me a script by that time, or even if not a script, would you agree to do it a little later? I say the word ""a little"" because if I write an opera, I will write it urgently. If you have nothing against these lines for now, I would like to know what fee you would like to receive from me for the libretto?
 
 Having deceived you before, I want to clarify this side of the issue in advance.
 
 If your answer to all this brings me your consent, and if your conditions are possible for me, then I would like to come to you in order to talk to you about this personally and in more detail.

"Letter to S. V. Smolensky, 1898","Dear Stepan Vasilyevich!
 
 I beg you to answer me the following question. The artist Chaliapin would like to place his brother, who is 14 years old, in your school, who, I think it necessary to tell you, knows notes rather poorly, reads and writes rather poorly, but who, in my opinion, has an excellent musical ear and great talent.
 
 The motives that made Chaliapin look for a place for his brother with you are the following: firstly, the boy is too unprepared for any special musical institution; secondly, this boy, since he is quite spoiled, needs a closed institution where he [would have] constant supervision. Other closed institutions, such as, for example, a cadet corps, are completely unthinkable, because the Chaliapins are peasants. So, I beg you to inform me whether you find it possible to enroll little Chaliapin in your school this autumn? If you agree, the great Shalyapin and I will come to you for more detailed conversations.

"Letter to M. I. Tchaikovsky, 1898","I hope, dear Modest Ilyich, that this letter will find you still in Petersburg. I am writing to thank you, firstly, for the libretto you sent me, which I generally like very, very much and which I will dwell on. Secondly, I will ask you to fulfill one of my requests and, thirdly, I need your answer to some of my questions regarding the libretto.
 
 The request is as follows. I would like you to compose about thirty stanzas for me for the invisible choir in the prologue. Maybe not thirty, but still a certain number of words, which I would divide and assign to different groups of the choir to sing. In addition, I would like to give the seven stanzas of Virgil (which begin with the words ""My son"") to the choirs, changing, of course, everywhere the pronouns ""she, they"" to ""we"".
 
 Will you find this possible? I would very much like you to say yes, otherwise, not being satisfied with just one phrase in the libretto, that groans are heard, I will have to write a symphonic picture only for the orchestra, which is a little annoying, because I have choirs at my disposal, since I am writing an opera. Give me, for God's sake, these words, Modest Ilyich!
 
 Now a question. I would like to know where you got the content of the first and second acts? Did you work out the plot about Francesca yourself, who is well-known, or was the story of her life written by someone earlier? Then the foreign words that occur during the wedding itself? What do these words mean? Finally, I am such an ignoramus that I do not even know what language this is? Latin or Italian? Or neither? Perhaps these are some spiritual cants that were sung on certain occasions, or perhaps they are still sung? If so, they can be obtained. I will not say anything more for now. The entire second act is magnificent for music. If I recall anything else, I would like the third act not to end with the words of Anunzio and one female choir, but to end with a general ensemble or at least a mixed choir; and a few more words for Paolo and Francesca in the last act, but more about that later.
 
 For now, I will ask you to answer me only the first two questions, and again addressed to Gutheil.
 
 Yours faithfully, S. Rachmaninov

"Letter to A. V. Zatayevich, 1898","Your request, dear friend Alexander Viktorovich, in your last letter, I could not fulfill. Moreover, your request is illegal. The publisher undertakes to give the author, if he receives a fee, five copies free of charge when publishing a work. The publisher sent you, as someone who did not receive a fee, ten copies. More cannot be demanded from him. I am surprised that he himself, without anyone's request, sent you such a number. In any case, this should be discussed when concluding the terms. Since I concluded the terms, it is either my fault that I did not foresee this or forgot about it - or yours that you did not warn me about it. Be that as it may, all you can do now is come to terms with it. When you write something new, and I am convinced that you will, then we will take this issue into account. So, when will I receive these new things of yours?
 
 I don‚Äôt know if you know that I have settled in the village, where I intend to spend the entire winter, in order to live and work in peace, since it is completely impossible to have and do this in Moscow. Besides, the doctor advised me, or rather prescribed this village life. Not long before this time, I was ill and even went to the Crimea to recover a little. Now I live in the village. I started to exercise a little and have gained a lot of weight. I live completely alone. However, I have three big friends with me. All three are huge St. Bernards. I talk with them, and I don‚Äôt feel scared to live and walk in the forests around me with them.

  Yesterday I received your letter, where you inform me that ""Aleko"" is supposed to be staged in the Tauride Palace. Of course, there are no obstacles on my part and there cannot be any. I am very happy and do not know who to thank for this desire and decision to stage my opera. I only regret that I did not find out about this earlier.

After all, here I am counting on a good performance and I want to think that this will smooth me over a little.
  
  I cannot appoint or recommend anyone for solo parts, because I know very few or no Petersburg singers. I want to ask you about this. Of course, you know them all, and therefore you can tell me which role suits whom. Be so kind, Anton Stepanovich, - do me this favor. Needless to say, of course, that I approve of your choice in advance and am pleased with it.

"Letter to N. D. Skalon, 1899","In my opinion, dear Tatusha, you and I are now approaching the fourth and at the same time the last period of our personal relations. About nine years ago, you and I first met and became acquainted. Before we had time to get to know each other well, we had already become friends. This was the first period: our friendship No. 1. We thought then that this friendship would never end and... as always, we were wrong.
  
  In order for friendly relations to exist for a long time and go smoothly, you need to have, as Goncharov says, a lot of heart and worldly logic, to be satisfied with wealth and not constantly prick each other with your shortcomings. We had enough heart, but we had no logic at all, and where could we get it from? ""We were young then,"" we got excited. We forgot to think about Goncharov then, or maybe we had not read him yet, and began to ""prick"" each other. This ""tingling"" spoiled, ""hurt"" (isn't it written poetically?) our friendship.
  
  Here our first period ended and the second began. I will call this second period the period of mutual cooling and will not describe it for long. Whatever I did, you found wrong and constantly scolded me, but I, in relation to you, of course, adhered to the same program. The only difference was that you scolded me in Petersburg, and I you in Moscow. The difference, I must admit, is small, and not relevant.
  
  Now, to be precise, I must add to my horror that this period No. 2 lasted much longer than the others. For six or seven years, we would probably have completely lost acquaintance, if we had not been connected by the same related family. And besides, the severity of our mutual cooling has weakened and subsided during this period - and we have aged greatly: we are no longer hot-blooded and pronounce the verb ""to love"" in the past tense.
  
  And so, thanks to all this, we have only recently approached the third period, which I will call the period of mutual concessions on account of the memory of the former friendship. There is absolutely nothing to say about this period, because it leads, in my opinion, immediately or rather quickly to the fourth and final period, namely, the period of friendship No. 2. I repeat that, in my opinion, this is so. Doesn't your sweet letter to me prove this? Doesn't your phrase that you seem to love me as before also prove this? And the fact that you were very sorry to leave Petersburg a few hours before my arrival there and your assumption, in which you were not mistaken, that I regretted it too - isn't this, so to speak, the first timid impulse towards our new, renewed and now true friendship No. 2. Oh! I have no doubt about it, at least at this moment... But what if this confidence is built on mistake? What then? Of course, there is a new friendship, but will it last long again?
  
  The thought that new and new periods will follow ad infinitum is downright capable of killing me. Again, then to figure out who is right, who is guilty; again, love, cooling, tingling, cursing, etc., etc. will follow in turn... I'd better not think about it. For now, I rejoice in your joys and cry over your tears and sorrows. It seems to me that I am your friend to the grave and that now, thank God, we are at the shore.

"Letter to N. D. Skalon, 1899","Three days ago I received your letter, dear Tatusha, and I won‚Äôt hide it from you, I would never have guessed its contents if I hadn‚Äôt read it. I won‚Äôt analyze its contents. You probably think about this story too much as it is to mention it to you again; and it‚Äôs hard to talk about it; and, finally, you yourself have analyzed it down to the last detail, of course. I won‚Äôt console you either, because I don‚Äôt know how. You‚Äôve probably noticed yourself that egoists are not consolers. I‚Äôll only tell you that I will never allow myself to call your story ‚Äúbanal‚Äù and that I sympathize with your grief as much as I can and know how...
  
  So, I won‚Äôt talk about that, but I want to talk to you about your second story, fortunately it‚Äôs much more comforting. You know, Tatusha, I was very sorry when I read that you left Reichenhall. For some reason it still seems to me that this ‚Äúsecond story‚Äù would have ended very well for you. As far as I can judge you and as far as I understand you, it seems to me that your heart is overflowing with love and is only looking for a convenient opportunity to speak out. Even if your feeling is rejected now, as you write, your love is only offended by this, and in no way diminished, and your current grief will only be lasting if you do not find some other person to whom you will transfer all your love, and with whom you will be just as happy or just as unhappy (it all depends not on you, but on him), as with the first person. In general, I want to say that your personal love will not change from the change, only your name will change. In my opinion, you, Skalon sisters, are the kind of people to whom happiness may not be given, but who will always be able to make it. And so I say that it seems to me that this person, with whom you would be able to live well, remained in Reichenhall. Forgive me if I have made a mistake in describing you. But I positively assert that your decision to go to Bayreuth to see Wagnerian operas will bring you great consolation, not to mention the fact that it is a great pleasure and entertainment. Yes! You are right! Art never betrays - at least those who love it, and I am the only exception to this rule. There was some misunderstanding between us, but I think that, God willing, art will soon take pity on me too and send me again those blessings that come from agreeing with it.
  
  Of course, I will be very glad to receive a letter from you from Bayreuth.

"Letter to M. A. Slonov, 1899","Dear friend Mikhail Akimovich!
  
  I have been meaning to answer your letter for a long time, but, as usual, these preparations have been going on for almost three weeks now. Please forgive me, and believe me that I was pleased to receive your letter and learn about your pastime. I was especially happy for you when I learned that you had been to the Caucasus and had seen the Georgian road. I think that after the Caucasus it is very difficult for you to live in Moscow. I don‚Äôt know how it is there, but here for the last twenty days the daytime temperature has not been below 40 degrees and has reached, as for example, the third day, 48. Such a temperature can drive anyone to despair and makes our entire local society useless. For some, who have a stronger and healthier nature, the heat has a soporific effect; for others, who are fatter, it is depressing (75% of our society is fat); on others, who have a nervous, impatient, capricious character, like the author of these lines, for example, this heat has a downright embittering effect. My ""Levka"" must be set completely apart. This one is a real sufferer. All day long he puffs like a steam engine, can't find a place for himself anywhere, pesters me terribly and irritates the third category described above even more. By the way, about ""Levka"". To my great chagrin, he is not growing at all. He has remained the same as I took him from Moscow two and a half months ago. For ten months his growth was satisfactory, but for a year his growth is no good. There is no point in thinking about an exhibition. He will fail there, like Trubetskoy with his ""Melusina""... Speaking of ""Melusina"", I remembered ""Aleko"", about the production of which I did not write to you; Yes, I think it is too late now because Gutheil has probably told you all the details. I can only add that Aleko sang magnificently from the first to the last note. The orchestra and choir were magnificent. The soloists were magnificent, not counting Chaliapin, before whom they all, like the others, constantly turned pale. He was three heads above them. By the way, I can still hear him sobbing at the end of the opera. Only a great artist on stage or a person who has suffered as much grief in ordinary life as Aleko can sob like that. In general, I got great pleasure from this whole trip, if you don‚Äôt count the fact that I spent a lot of money, which I had to borrow, of course. What else can I write to you?

"Letter to N. D. Skalon, 1899","I want to write you at least a few lines, dear Tatusha, in order to try to elicit your answer, which, thanks to the friendly truce concluded between us not long ago, touches and interests me very much. Well, how do you feel now that you have returned to Petersburg? How are your affairs going? You, of course, understand what affairs I am asking you about! All people, the whole universe, always and everywhere have only three kinds of affairs: matters of the heart, money and business, and each of these kinds occupies the whole person in turn. However, there are many variations here, it is impossible to recount them all. The only thing that can be said with certainty is that when a person is occupied at the same time by two of the above-mentioned kinds of affairs, then one of these kinds cannot be a matter of the heart, because these affairs only interfere with all other affairs. The entire beautiful half of the human race is occupied for the most part all their lives with that kind of affairs which does not tolerate, as I just wrote, the interference of anything outside. So, I am asking you, how are your affairs of the heart going? As for me, all my affairs and thoughts are second-rate. I only think about: ""How can I get it?"" ""Where can I get it?"" And less often - ""How can I give it?"" You, probably, think the same way: ""What is he? Will he come? What will he say?"" and very often: ""Isn't it a sin for him to act like this?"" However, I do not claim, of course, that you think so, but I positively claim that my thoughts are expressed correctly. And having communicated them to you, I have almost nothing more to say about myself. As always in the summer, I have gained a lot of weight, and at the end of September, as always, I am planning to leave for Moscow.
  
  So, I am impatiently awaiting your answer.
  
  Sincerely yours, S. Rachmaninov

I promised and remembered this promise only on the eve of my departure, when I could no longer do anything.

  Your letter arrived yesterday. I was very glad to receive it, and also to learn that you have settled in well, that it is beautiful, comfortable, and fun. I would gladly accept your invitation, if it were possible. But it is inconvenient for me. Now I do not want to be interrupted by my studies, and in June, on my way abroad, I would have to make a big detour to get to you, and this is because I have changed my route, i.e. I am not going through Constantinople because of the plague quarantine (which I have already informed Fedya about), but I am going through Odessa and Warsaw. It seems that A. Chekhov is going with me, at least he agreed. Thus, Batumi is not on the way at all. And I repeat, I am very sorry about this, because I would gladly live with you with you. Somehow until another time. There is almost nothing to write about myself. I am not studying very much, but I am careful. I live a quiet and peaceful life - and it's quite boring. I meet a lot of friends in the city garden and on the embankment, but I rarely go to sit with them. Mostly at home, and in my room. You see how boring and uninteresting it all is.
  
  Give my regards to all of you and my gratitude for the invitation. I especially wish Anna Timofeevna to gain more strength and impressions for new and new stories, for our consolation.

And second, that I won't go to Paris, since I spent more money on the trip than I expected. And in the end, it's just sadness again. Maybe you'll stop by here?

  Your letter did not find me in Crimea, but it was forwarded to me here, in Italy. Today I received it and I hasten to answer you. Two years have passed since I was with you in Klin, and in these two years, except for one romance, I have not composed a single note. In general, I have lost this ability to compose completely, apparently, and all my thoughts are directed towards returning it. To be honest, I wanted to try to write Francesca again this summer, hoping that maybe now something will come of it, and that is why I want to ask you, if you think it possible, to write to your candidate, well, at least that Rachmaninov is now abroad and that you will give an answer regarding Francesca upon his return, i.e. in September, when I undertake, in the event that I again fail, to abandon the subject.
  
  If this is impossible, then tell me, and I will send you the libretto right now. Although you did not work on this libretto specifically for me, I certainly do not dare to risk leaving you without a composer for it again.

  I was very glad to receive your letter, dear friend Nikita Semyonovich, and not only am I not angry at your ""admonitions,"" as you say, but I am very grateful to you for them. All this always has an invigorating effect on me. I lived here for another ten days after my first letter to you, and I continue to express regret that I did not go with you. The kind of home regime that exists here is not for me, and not according to my habits. Undoubtedly, I made a mistake! Although I have a separate room, there is sometimes such a shouting and noise around it that you can only encounter it in a house like ours. ""General Kheraskov"" himself is not here yet. He has not arrived yet. He is stuck in Paris, where he is intensively engaged, it seems, in the women's question. In knowledgeable circles they say that it is unlikely that the ""General"" will resolve this issue soon, firstly because of its complexity, and secondly because it is raised in Paris, where this issue is of more interest than any other. He shoots out rare telegrams from there, in which he speaks vaguely about his arrival. With his arrival, I will, of course, be happier... I have decided not to go to you now. I want to continue to study carefully. And I ask you to write to me at least occasionally, especially from Paris, where, it seems, you will soon go. Also let me know your address from there, just in case. Maybe I will come to you there, especially if ""Kheraskov"" is there.

  For now I'll tell you that I won't be here long now, at least I think I'll leave no later than the 20th. I'm leaving here (I don't want to hide it) with great pleasure.

In order to be completely annoying, I will allow myself to address a request to Yuli Ivanovich, which I will ask you to convey to him. The matter is this. Could Yuli Ivanovich write to Voronezh to have a piano sent to me before my arrival? I agree to take any that is available in the store. The only thing I would like is for the piano to have a moderator, and if there isn't one, then it's fine without one. Finally, maybe last year's instrument is still in the store.

"Letter to I. A. Buninu, 1901","I will not come to you. My work is going poorly, and there is little time left. I am in despair... I sincerely wish you success today and a safe journey tomorrow. I hope that you will let me know the next time you come, and then I will certainly come to you.
 
 Yours, S. Rachmaninov
 
 Thank you for the poems you sent and for the inscription.
 
 I managed to read a little, but what I read was very good and I really liked it.
