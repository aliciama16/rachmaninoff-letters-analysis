A. K. Glazunov,Person,https://walkerhomeschoolblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/glazunov.jpg,"А. К. Глазунову - Alexander Konstantinovich Glazunov[a][b] (10 August [O.S. 29 July] 1865 – 21 March 1936) was a Russian composer, music teacher, and conductor of the late Russian Romantic period. He was director of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory between 1905 and 1928 and was instrumental in the reorganization of the institute into the Petrograd Conservatory, then the Leningrad Conservatory, following the Bolshevik Revolution. He continued as head of the Conservatory until 1930, though he had left the Soviet Union in 1928 and did not return.[1] The best-known student under his tenure during the early Soviet years was Dmitri Shostakovich.[2]

Glazunov successfully reconciled nationalism and cosmopolitanism in Russian music. While he was the direct successor to Balakirev's nationalism, he tended more towards Borodin's epic grandeur while absorbing a number of other influences. These included Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestral virtuosity, Tchaikovsky's lyricism and Taneyev's contrapuntal skill. Younger composers such as Prokofiev and Shostakovich eventually considered his music old-fashioned, while also admitting he remained a composer with an imposing reputation, and a stabilizing influence in a time of transition and turmoil.[3]"

Крейцер -  August 20 marks the 145th anniversary of the birth of Elena Yulievna Zhukovskaya, née Kreutzer (1875–1961). A pianist, singer, and vocal teacher, she is best known today as the author of memoirs about S. V. Rachmaninoff. She was 18 years old when she felt drawn to music and began taking piano lessons from the then young composer. Their communication developed into a strong, cordial friendship that both of them carried through their entire lives. Sergei Vasilyevich Rachmaninoff admired Elena Yulievna’s willpower, the orderliness of her thoughts, and her ability to stick to a planned lesson plan. She played 4–5 hours a day, solving theoretical musical problems. Even when he was busy or away, Sergei Vasilyevich did not forget to write letters asking for help to his student. These lessons continued from 1893 to 1901. During the summer months, S. Rachmaninov spent long periods of time in the Kreutzer family home. Rachmaninov's future wife, Natalia Satina, was a close friend of Elena Yulievna."
